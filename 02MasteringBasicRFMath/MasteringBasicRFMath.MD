# Mastering Basic RF Math

### Watts, Milliwatts, dBi, dBm (Decible Milliwatts)

**Watts:** Watts is a measure of electical energy. How much electrical energy consume, how much electrical energy sent or how much electrical energy receive.

**Milliwatts:** A thousandth watt is a milliwatt.

*A radio station can be broadcast 50,000 watts.*
*Microwave oevn: 1000 watts.*
*Wi-Fi AP: 1 to 100mW.*

**The Decible Scale:** Initially designed to compare sounds values, but can compare any powers as long as we add the unit to "db", to show that the reference is.
