# Connecting Antennas


### Radiation Parameter Chart


### Antenna Signal and Direction

- Patch Antenna (1 derection antenna)
- Yagi Antenna (Yagi Ude) (Butterfly effect)
- Dish Antenna


### Omnidirectional Antennas

*Omnidirectional Antenna is often on screen side and is often rubber duck type. Ruber duck elevation plane. (E-Plane)*

- **ceilling mount** or **mast mount** (outdoot) omnis.
- Higher gain in the E-plane, narrower coverage in the H-plane.

- Special **dual omni**


### Antenna Signal and Polarization

- Antenna signal is not the same in E-plane and H-plane
- This is because the antenna signal is polarized -- the signal send has an orientation

**Polarization is important... especially outdoor! Respecting polarization logic indoor is always a good idea.**
