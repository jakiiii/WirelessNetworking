# Measuring RF Signals

### Signal Strength

- Received Singnal Strength Indicator (RSSI) show how much signal was received.
- Usally a negative number (e.g. - -76 dBm)
- Is vendor dependent.
	- 2 vendor cards at same spot may read diffrent RSSI.
	- RSSI shows ability to convert RF wave into 0s and 1s.

### (Signal To Noise Ratio) SNR

- There is RF everywhare (comming from earth heat, space, human activity, ...)
- The amount of "unwanted RF" is called (background noise).
- RSSI - noise level = Signal to Notise Ratio (SNR)
