# Characteristics of Frequency, Amplitude, Phase and Wavelength

**Frequency:** Frequency is defined as the number of times an event occurs pre unit of time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast of spatial frequency and angular frequency.

**Radio Frequency:** Radio frequency is the oscillation rate of an alternating electric current or voltage or af an magnetic, electrics or electromagnetic field or mechanical system in the freuency range from around 20kHz to around 300 GHz.

**Amplitude:** The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a signal period.

**Phase:** In physics and mathematics, the phase of a periodic function of some real variable is the relative value of the variable within the span of each full period. The phase is typical express as an angle, in such a scale that is varies by one full turn as the variable goes through each period.

**Wavelength:** The weblenght is the spatial preiod of a periodic wave the distance over which the wave's shape repeats.

**Relation between wavelength and frequency is:** Frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional to each other. The wave with the greatest frequency has the shortest wavelength. Twich the frequency means one half the wavelength. For this reason, the wavelength ratio is the inverse of the frequency.

**F = c/λ** and **λ = c/F**

```
c 	= Speen of licht
λ	= lamda is web length
F	= Frequency
```
